          The Command Line Interface (CLI) assigns a unique sample ID and registers samples in the backend service using the sample data file. Only metadata specified in the metadata catalog is uploaded, while other data remains in the receipt file sent to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The CLI uploads sequence data to the designated sequence data bucket. Once confirmed, the receipt file containing source metadata and the assigned Congenica sample ID is uploaded to the UKHSA S3 bucket.

      <li>
        <p>
          The pipeline runs, scaling out over an AWS Batch queue as needed, and writes results to the results bucket. Results include a results.csv file with per-sample results and a resultsfiles.json file identifying bulk data associated with the samples.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The watcher process is notified of pipeline completion as it monitors jobs via the Kubernetes API.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Upon job completion, the watcher records the job status and timings in the database.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The result loader is then invoked, distributing the loading work through a Celery queue. As results are loaded, the trigger manager is notified of specific steps completing, triggering configured export jobs via the Celery queue.

      <h4>2. Optimizing Performance for Large Datasets:</h4>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Realizing the project's objective of processing large datasets in near real-time presented challenges in performance optimization. The system needed to efficiently handle vast amounts of sequencing data while meeting stringent timeframes.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Implementing an innovative approach, we optimized performance to meet the defined benchmark. The system ensures that, during normal use, outputs on a sample are generated within 4 hours of loading the sequence, maintaining efficiency and timely delivery.</p>

      <h4>3. Integration of an Event-Driven System:</h4>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Introducing an event-driven system added complexity, particularly concerning scalability and performance. Coordinating real-time events across a distributed environment required a robust architecture to ensure responsiveness and reliability.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Our architecture successfully integrates an event-driven system, providing the flexibility needed for real-time coordination. This ensures the platform's reliability, scalability, and responsiveness in handling events across the distributed environment.</p>

      <h4>4. Ensuring Data Consistency and Standardization:</h4>
      <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Standardizing data formats across laboratories for consistency introduced challenges related to data integrity and uniformity. Ensuring diverse datasets adhered to standardized formats was crucial for meaningful comparative analysis.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We implemented rigorous standards and protocols to ensure data consistency. The collaborative effort of data ingest, sample manager, rules engine, protocol manager, metadata catalog, and tag catalog not only validates data but also adds appropriate tags, ensuring uniformity and integrity across diverse datasets.</p>
